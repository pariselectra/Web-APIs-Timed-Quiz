# Web-APIs-Timed-Quiz

## Description

This was the fourth challenge of my coding bootcamp at UT Austin. The purpose of this challenge was to incorporate the usage of Web APIs to link HTML, CSS, and Javascript into one functional webpage. The completition criteria was specific. The program must contain a timer, that starts when a question is presented. Time must also be subtracted from the timer if a question is answered incorrectly. The game is over when the timer is at zero. Finally, the user can save their initials and score.

In order to edit each element of HTML code within Javascript, I used Web APIs to connect the Javascript elements. To start the quiz, there is a central start button. Once the start button is clicked, the timer starts and the quiz begins. If a user selects an incorrect answer, the answer lights up red. If the user selects the correct answer, it lights up green. I wrote the program to automatically switch to the next question after two seconds of selecting their answer. This gives the user the opportunity to see if they selected the correct answer. At the completition of the quiz, I used jQuery to program a form that allows the user to save their score. The score reads as a percentage of correct answers.

This was an excellent practice in Web APIs, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
